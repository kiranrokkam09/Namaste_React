1. props are the properties that are passed in json format to react component.

2. Config Driven UI:
        It is controlling the UI using the config or data from the backend.

3. While looping using map function every item in the loop should be given a unique key.If the key is not given and once a new item is added,
    the react will render all the items in the list again, but with the unique keys the react exactly knows the new item and only renders the
    item this will give you a huge optimization.

4. React itself recommends not to use indexes as key of the loops because order of the items may change.

5. Not using key(Not acceptable) <<<<< using index as key <<<<<<<<<<<<< using unique id as key (Best Practice).
