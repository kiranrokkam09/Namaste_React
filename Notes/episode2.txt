1. npm doesnot stands for node package manager it is just a package manager that has all the packages in it.

2. Package.json is a configuration for npm.

3. There are 2 types are dependencies we can install.
    a. Dev dependency (-D)
        it is used for development purpose.
    b. Normal dependency
        it is used for both development and production.

4. Caret (^) in package.json:
    It is used for automatically updating the minor updates along with patch updates.

5. Tilde (~) in package.json: 

    (**This can break the app sometimes as it updates even in major updates**)

    It is used to match the most recent patch version. Tilde ~ notation freezes the major version and minor version. 
    As we know patch updates are bug fixes thatâ€™s why we can say ~ notation allows us to automatically accept bug fixes. 

6. Package lock.json: (Exact version of dependencies)
    This is a lockfile that holds information on the dependencies or packages installed for a node. js project, including their exact version numbers.

7. Package.json: (Aproximate version of dependencies)
    This is the primary format for configuring and describing how to communicate with and execute your application.

8. Node modules:
    When we install a package using NPM all the code fetched for the package is stored in node modules.

9. Node modules are very large due to transitive dependencies(one package needs other packages to run).

10. NPM is used for installing the packages and NPX is used for executing the packages.

11. CDN links are not the preferred way of bringing react and reactDOM into our project.Installing react using npm is the preffered way as
    it will be included in the node modules and can be easily used in the project.

12. During the build of parcel remove the main in package.json.

13. parcel is a file bundler.
