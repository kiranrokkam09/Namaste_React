1. Two types of Exports/Import

    1.1 Default Export/Import

        export default Component;
        import Component from "path";

    1.2 Named Export/Import

        export const Component;
        import {Component} from "path";

2. Never keep Constant data inside a Component.

3. React Hooks - Nothing but a simple javascript utility functions.

    3.1 useState() - Creates state variable in react.

    3.2 useEffect() - 

4. Whenever a State variable updates the react will rerender it's components.

5. Reconciliation(Whenever something changes is called conciliation) Algorithm (React fiber) (came in React 16)

6. Virual DOM - Virtual DOM is representation of actual DOM.It is nothing but a normal javascript object.

7. Diff Algorithm - Whenever there is a change in the component the react will check the difference between the newly created virtual dom
    and the old virtual dom and then changes the actual dom.The react doesn't always touches the actual dom that is why react is faster.
