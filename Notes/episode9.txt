1. To optimize the app, Only one component should have one work to do(i.e displaying data, fetching data).
2. If we follow the above point we will follow the modularity principle which means the code is divided 
    into small modules.
3. for the modularity we use custom hooks.
4. when defining the custom hooks use 'use' as the prefix to the name of the hook.
5. Chuking (or) code splitting (or) dynamic bundling (or) lazy loading (or) on demand loading (or) dynamic 
    import:- Making the application into smaller chunks.
